# GitHub Folder Icon for Mac

A simple folder icon for Macs to represent your GitHub folder.

Created by [Richard Girardin](http://girard.in) based on the [GitHub logo and mark](https://github.com/logos).

## How to Use

First, download the [icon file](https://github.com/rmgirardin/mac-github-folder/blob/master/GitHubFolderIcon.icns). Go to the folder you want to change the icon of and pull up the information pane by left-clicking the folder and clicking 'Get Info' or pressing âŒ˜I when the folder is selected. Then drag and drop the .icns file to the picture of the folder on the top left. If you need more help, check out [Apple's support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201737).

## Legal

The GitHub logo is not mine, it is GitHub's. You can [read the legal stuff](https://github.com/logos#legal_verbiage) if you want to.
